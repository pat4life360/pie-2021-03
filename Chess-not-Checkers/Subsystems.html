								<p>The code for controlling and tracking the flow of a game as well as directing the steppers and electromagnet is held in Python. The two Arduinos are responsible for implementing the commands sent from Python through Serial ports. One Arduino is responsible for motors and the other for the hall effect sensors.</p>
								<p>The class that controls the game and keeps track of the player’s and AI’s moves is the Board class from the documented Python Chess Library. This library does the heavy lifting in terms of checking for invalid moves, wins, checkmates, etc.</p>
								<p>The chess engine we used to be the AI chess player was the Stockfish 14.1 chess engine. Through the Pychess library and the UCI (Universal chess interface), the chess engine receives the moves of the player and responds accordingly. Then the engine’s move is translated to physical changes.</p>

														<h2>Mechanical</h2>

												<p>The two goals for the mechanical subsystem was to find a way to move the pieces across the board, and build an external structure to house the components.</p>
												<p>The first of the two was done using an electromagnet moved by a two-axis gantry system, in turn controlled by two NEMA 17 stepper motors. We designed and 3D printed all mounts for the steppers, rods, electromagnets and bearings, allowing us to achieve very precise fits and iterate quickly between versions of the parts. (Optional: Insert CAD of electromagnet mount).The stepper motors themselves were connected to m8 “fast threaded” rods, typically used in 3D printers, by couplings. Two unthreaded rods were added to provide stability to the system.</p>
												<p>To house the gantry system, we laser cut boards of MDF to specific dimensions</p>
												<p>We decided to make the playing field 20x20”. This is the standard size used in American tournaments and would allow our pieces enough space to pass in between squares without disturbing other pieces that may reside in those squares.</p>

													<p>Ball Bearing Mount: This is used to hold the ball bearing that allows one of the two rods (y-axis) to spin without resistance. This was designed so that the center of the rod was 25mm from the ground, allowing the pieces to move freely.</p>
													<span class ="image fit"><img src="images/Electromagnet mount.PNG" ></span>
													<figcaption>Electromagnet Mount: This is used to hold the electromagnet that makes the piece move across the board. It is stabilised by two rods: one threaded, connected to the mount via a special nut that allows it to move, and one unthreaded, connected to the mount via a linear bearing.</figcaption>

													<p>Full assembly: This is the full assembly of our hardware system. Its main components are two: the box and the gantry.</p>

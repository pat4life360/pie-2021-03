            <h2>Mechanical Design</h2>
            <h3>Swerve Module</h3>

            <p>
              Normally, swerve modules use two motors mounted on top, and using
              gears, they transfer the ability to pivot and spin dnow to the
              wheel. This has the advantage of pivoting without limitation to
              the range or reaching a maximum angle. Unfortunately, these
              modules are very expensive and would alone put us outside of our
              budget.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to limitations in budget and performance of 3D-printed parts,
              we decided to form our own iteration of a swerve drive module that
              fits our needs. It uses a servo on one side of the platform to
              rotate the module and a drive motor that’s on the module for
              spinning the wheel that uses gears to convert the rotation from
              the motor to the wheel axle. The module assembly connects to the
              servo by an aluminum shaft.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to make the swerve module durable and easily
              maintainable, we made several key design decisions. We avoided
              using any 3D printed gears because they have low durability and
              high friction. Instead, we used aluminum pulleys with belts and
              shafts to transfer motion. We also 3D printed our own wheel hubs
              to have a larger contact area to the axle and more stability for
              the wheel. Additionally, for ease of changes and replacements to
              parts, all attachments to shafts are done using 3D printed clamps.
            </p>

            <h3>Connecting the Modules to the Platform</h3>
            <p>
              We decided to use a T-slot extrusion frame as a base to our
              platform for its stability and modularity. To prevent any
              unnecessary tension on the servo head, we mounted the servo on one
              side of the platform with 3D printed brackets and restrained the
              shaft through a 3D-printed bushing. For stability, we ensured that
              the bushing has two points of constraint: the main platform and a
              secondary mini-platform. We added shields to the edges of the
              platform to prevent damage to the swerve modules in case of a
              collision. The wires leading to the drive motors were also
              restrained with zip ties to prevent damage to solder points.
            </p>

                  An exploded view of a full module is shown above. A full
                  module is all of the parts necessary to drive each wheel. At
                  the top, we have the servo motor, which controls rotation
                  about the vertical axis. It contains an attachment piece that
                  adapts to the servo motor shaft. We drilled into the outermost
                  holes to increase the diameter in order to fit the smallest
                  size screws we had access to in the shop. This is how we
                  mounted the servo motor to the shaft adapter. The shaft
                  adapters are mounted onto the main shaft, tightened down via a
                  screw and nut. The shaft goes through the shaft sleeve, which
                  fits perfectly long inside the main platform, and supports the
                  main shaft as a fixed hinge, further stabilizing the module.
                  The lower shaft adapter is secured onto the wheel housing by
                  epoxy, which is very strong and will not easily come off. The
                  wheel housing contains the necessary components for driving
                  the robot, including the drive motor, drive shaft, wheel, belt
                  and pulley.

            <p>
              Multiple iterations of this design were created to account for
              issues that we had unforeseen. Due to the high torques caused by
              the wheels and experienced by the shaft adapters, we redesigned
              the shaft adapters to be stronger and better able to withstand
              these forces. Before using epoxy we were using superglue, but the
              superglue wore off and the shaft adapter ripped off due to these
              high forces. We decided to reinforce our design by using a
              combined method of epoxy and heat set insert, which we attempted
              and tested by using a mini torch to heat up a metal rod and
              inserting it through the shaft adapter hole and into the wheel
              housing. We quickly learned that epoxy does not melt, but this did
              not inhibit our design since the epoxy was found to be more than
              strong enough to support the driving forces.

                  In addition, to further protect our robot, we decided to add
                  transparent bumpers to protect the modules from external
                  forces/ contact. We decided to implement this considering how
                  fast our robot drives and because we accidentally ran over a
                  small object in testing and this broke our shaft adapter. This
                  made us consider new design decisions that not only strengthen
                  our robot but also protect it from experiencing any
                  unnecessary loads when possible. Even with the bumpers
                  implemented, the robot was still accidentally crashed into a
                  corner and the corner of the bumpers broke. This validated our
                  decision since we were prepared for this load on the robot by
                  allowing the bumpers to absorb the force of impact rather than
                  the modules, which would have likely broken in place of the
                  bumpers in their absence.

              This shaft adapter concept is used to clamp to the trans-platform
              aluminum shaft to transfer torque from the servos to the wheel
              assembly. The same piece can connect to the servo horn using the
              holes at the base of the part via a screw and nut, and it is glued
              with epoxy to the wheel housing and all the respective parts.
              Originally, the design on the left was used, however, we noticed
              multiple flaws with it. First, the screw mounts at the top were
              too thin and they collapsed under the force from the screws while
              being tightened to the shaft. Second, the walls for the mount were
              too thin so they broke easily. To remedy the second issue, we made
              the walls thicker and changed the 3D print orientation such that
              the print lines are along the length of the shaft, using the
              “grain” of the 3D printer in our favor for strengthening the part.

                  minimize friction, but still maintain enough constraint. It
                  acts as a fixed hinge and serves as another point of contact
                  while also stabilizing each module, keeping it as vertical as
                  possible (shaft should be perpendicular to the ground).

                  This is the main housing for the swerve module. It holds the
                  drive motor, pulleys, and the wheels. Originally, the frame
                  was wider and longer, but we found that the extra size took
                  additional time to print, did not add much advantage, and had
                  a concerning small clearance between the bottom of it and the
                  ground. We also went through multiple iterations with the
                  design to allow for better integration with the motor and the
                  gears that connected the wheel and the motor to get optimal
                  tension in the pulley and that all parts were properly
                  supported. We wanted to make sure that the part did not take
                  too long to print, so we added aesthetically pleasing cutouts
                  to serve a dual purpose.

                  and reduce friction in the tires. We also designed the wheels
                  to have mounts for each side built into the design to help
                  stabilize the wheel and keep it vertical. We did encounter
                  some spacing issues with our wheels in the wheel housing since
                  the wheels with the mounts were wide enough to take up the
                  majority of the available shaft space in the housing, so it
                  was difficult to access the screws to tighten the wheel down.
                  <br /><br />
                  We purchased collars that fit around the drive shaft since we
                  needed to constrain the position of the shaft via a fixed
                  hinge in the horizontal direction. We also implemented
                  bearings to reduce the load on the shaft and spacers to reduce
                  friction between the tire and the housing wall.

                  We used the platform shaft sleeve to constrain horizontal
                  motion of the swerve drive module, but decided against
                  constraining vertical motion from the assumption that the
                  servo can handle that amount of force pushing into the
                  gearbox. To achieve this design, we made the servo mount to
                  hold the servo a certain distance from the platform such that
                  there is only a little clearance between the shaft adapter and
                  the platform shaft sleeve. As a result of the four servos
                  holding up the weight of the robot, we do not have to deal
                  with much friction between any of our custom parts.

                  After discussing an earlier iteration of the swerve-bot with
                  the professors, they suggested we add a second point of
                  contact to support the “platform shaft sleeve.” At the time,
                  we only had the top of it mounted to the platform using
                  screws. Since the job of the platform shaft sleeve was to
                  minimize any horizontal motion in the swerve module, and it
                  was going to have a lot of stress, we decided that a good
                  solution to add a second point of contact would be a mini
                  platform. This platform goes on the underside of the frame and
                  the platform shaft sleeve fits snugly into the large hole.
                  This was successful in preventing excess stress on the main
                  point of attachment.

                  Using T-slot extrusion rails made it very convenient to form
                  the frame and attach objects to it. We decided on a square
                  design for the frame, using the inner sides to mount the
                  brackets. We used this design that had two points of contact
                  on each side for increased stability in addition to the large
                  filet for stiffness of the frame.

                  The inner diameter of both pulleys in a set is 5mm. This is
                  perfect for the steel rod used to transfer energy to the
                  wheel, however, the drive motor shaft diameter is
                  significantly smaller, a larger tolerance than expected. This
                  caused the pulley to be positioned off-center and resulted in
                  the whole assembly vibrating intensely. Our solution to this
                  was to 3D print a sleeve that goes around the motor shaft,
                  extending its outer diameter to just under 5mm. This resolved
                  the vibration issue.

                  The top plate was designed to give the project an interesting
                  visual when the robot is spinning. We laser cut a piece of MDF
                  with the main design, a sheet of acrylic and used epoxy we
                  used for other parts to adhere these to one another. The
                  entire cover attaches to the four servos with velcro for easy
                  detachment when we are adjusting the electronics. In order to
                  really showcase the pattern, we added LED strips underneath to
                  shine through.

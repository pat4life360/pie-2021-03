					<h2>Electrical Design</h2>
					<p><i>An overview of key electrical design decisions we made.</i></p>

					<h3>Computers</h3>
					<p>For the electrical design, we decided to use LiPo batteries and a Raspberry Pi to communicate
						over wifi with a laptop in order to create an untethered robot. To control the motors and
						servos, we used Arduinos rather than the Pi because we were more familiar with that setup, and
						started out with two Arduino Unos because one Uno did not have enough PWM pins for all of our
						motors and servos. When our Arduino Mega arrived during Sprint 3, we found that it was having
						communication problems with the Pi. After trying to debug for hours, we didnâ€™t think we would be
						able to get it working and went back to using the Unos as they were already a functional
						solution. </p>

					<h3>Motor Drivers</h3>
					<p>We also had some trouble with our motor controllers and ended up trying out three different ones
						to find one that worked. We first tried Amazon RC Car Motor Controllers rated for up to 40A, but
						could not find a manual anywhere on the internet. After unsuccessfully trying to induce a
						response by sending signals over PWM at different frequencies and duty cycles, we gave up and
						borrowed an L298N Motor Driver. The L298 had a manual and tutorials and we were able to
						successfully operate it, but the problem was that it was heating up due to having only a 2A peak
						output current which was too low for even a single one of our motors. At that point, we
						researched high-current rated motor drivers with good supporting documentation at a low price
						point and found the BTS7960 High Power Motor Driver Module which came with arduino example code
						and was rated up to 43A. This experience taught us a lot about how to use motor drivers and what
						factors are important to take into account when choosing one. </p>

					<h3>RGB LED Strips</h3>
					<p>After adding LEDs, it seemed that the wifi signal from the pi would stop working at random times
						including while the robot was driving, and continue driving until it hits something. We think
						this was because the Pi is sensitive to power changes. We added a second portable power bank
						rated for 5V and 2A to power the pi which fixed the issue.</p>


					<h3>Layout</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<p>In terms of the physical layout of the electronics on the robot, we made several
								decisions which contributed to overall success. Firstly, we stacked the breadboard for
								power distribution on top of the battery since we wanted the battery to be in the center
								for weight distribution and the breadboard to be in the center to reduce wire lengths.
								To make this stacked configuration work, we put together a quick battery box which held
								the battery and allowed it to be swapped out easily. We bolted down the battery box as
								well as many of the other electrical components to prevent them from falling off since
								we tended to flip the robot over often for both storage and testing purposes. This
								layout also helped keep our electronics compact in the center of the robot.</p>

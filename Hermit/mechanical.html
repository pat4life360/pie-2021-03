											<h3>Summary</h3>
											<p>
												The robot is built to look and act similarly to a hermit crab. 
												It has a shell that hides its electronics, and two curved legs 
												to drag itself forward with. If picked up, its head will retreat 
												into the shell until it is put back down. The basic design is built 
												from 2 base plates that hold all the components of the robot. 
												These components sit in snug 3D printed mounts. One plate is 
												mounted to the other with 3D printed triangular pieces. Two large 
												motors drive semicircular metal sheet legs, and two castor wheels 
												also support the robot. A servo motor and linkage system can 
												retract the “head” along a slot slider. 
											</p>
										</section>
									</div>

										<section class="box"> 
											<h3>Base plates</h3>
											<p>
												The angled design for the base plates was chosen to optimize space 
												usage and allow the shell to cover a significant amount of the 
												electronics without interfering with the legs. The angled plate 
												also lets the slot slider move at that angle, making it easier 
												to retreat into the shell. The plates were laser cut from 
												Eucaboard, which is strong yet light, to minimize the weight of 
												our robot. The plates are held together and at an angle using 
												two 3D printed triangular mounting blocks. Each block has two 
												screw holes for each plate, and holds the top plate at the 
												ideal 35° angle for the head to be parallel to the ground. 
												The triangles are large since they are the only support for 
												the top plate and hold the robot together.

											<h3>Movement</h3>
											<p>
												The movement of our robot was inspired by the R-Hex robot. 
												We have two curved legs made of sheet metal with added 
												traction to move the robot forward, along with two castor 
												wheels to support the robot. The sheet metal has some 
												springiness to it, and is strong enough to push the robot. 
												The motors do not have encoders, so the legs do not move 
												in sync with each other. This is a drawback to switching 
												to more powerful motors, but the wobbly movement also looks 
												similar to an animal. The speed of each motor can be adjusted 
												to allow the robot to turn when following a person.

											<h3>Slot slider</h3>
											<p>
												The head retraction movement of our hermit crab was controlled 
												by a slot slider mechanism. This consists of one head (which 
												acts as a sensor mount), two linkages, and a servo. The head 
												is supported by a “neck” at a 35 degree angle: this way, the 
												sensors are parallel with the ground when mounted on our 
												angled frame. This “neck” allows .1” of clearance in the 
												slot both along the diameter of the neck and the height 
												of the neck. There is also a linkage mount on the back of 
												the head. The linkages and head are 3D printed and the servo 
												mount is laser-cut from Eucaboard. The linkages are connected 
												to each other using screws and locknuts, and one linkage is 
												connected to the servo with the use of a servo horn screwed 
												into the linkage. 
											</p>
											<h3>Component mounts</h3>
											<p>
												Component mounts were carefully measured and 3D printed to 
												keep everything secure. The space on the base plates was used 
												well so they could be as small as possible.

											<h3>Throwing</h3>
											<p>
												One of our original goals was to make our hermit crab durable 
												enough to be thrown without significant damage. Because of time 
												constraints, focusing on different things, and the sheer danger 
												of throwing something so heavy and dense, we decided not to pursue 
												this goal. Some durable shell options we explored were: injection 
												molding a shell shape and lining the shell with composites, foam, 
												or oobleck; creating a shell and covering it with little hooks that 
												would act as springs to dampen impact force; and using vibration 
												resistant washers when connecting anything to the frame of our robot.

											<h3>Slot slider</h3>
											<p>
												We began designing the slot slider mechanism in Sprint 2. Originally, 
												the sensors were both facing forward. In the final design, they are 
												120 degrees apart to increase our hermit crab’s range of vision. 
												We also considered designing this mechanism to also move the shell 
												down over the head. We later determined that this was unnecessary. 
												The final design also has a longer linkage connected to the servo 
												(to increase the travel), is more space efficient, and has more 
												clearance between parts (where the original design would interfere 
												with other parts in the assembly).
											</p>
											<p>
												Below, the original design is shown in the two left images. The final
												design, with the changes described, is shown in the rightmost image.

												We started testing our hermit crab using the MP3 car kits.

												torque would be when speccing motors (the motors that came 
												with the kit were nowhere near torque-y enough).

												In Sprint 2, we introduced the idea of using 2 baseplates to save space, 
												allow the slot slider to slide up into the shell, and potentially allow 
												for protecting more sensitive parts on the top baseplate (assuming they 
												would be the most safe within the shell). When fabricating, we laser-cut 
												what you see below. We then drilled holes into the baseplates where we 
												needed them. We had some small problems with the holes not lining up 
												properly, so we made sure to include holes with precise locations when 
												we laser cut our final baseplate structure. In Sprint 2, we also 
												produced the angle between the two base plates with a third wall that 
												held up the end of the angled baseplate. In our final product, we used 
												a triangle with nuts and bolts to hold the angled base plate up. We 
												also added the servo mount.

												Our motor mounts needed to change as we got new motors.

												iteration is shown to the lower left.

												In Sprint 2, our leg mounts were two halves, which were press-fit 
												onto the motor shafts. In Sprint 3, we used a set screw to secure 
												the leg mount to the motor. The leg mounts are shown to the right.

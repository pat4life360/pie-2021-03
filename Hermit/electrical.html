										<h3>Electrical Requirements</h3>
										<p>
											To meet the goal of having a crab that walks towards you and 
											hides its head into its shell when picked up, we needed the 
											following electrical requirements:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Motors that are powerful enough to move the weight of the crab forward</li>
											<li>Sensors that can tell where a person is</li>
											<li>A sensor to tell when the crab is picked up</li>
											<li>A servo to move the crab's head out of and into its shell</li>
											<li>A way to supply enough power to all of the above</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											The electrical schematic for this system is shown.

											<h3>Motors</h3>
											<p>
												To control the motors, we have a motor shield. The motor shield 
												has a fully-dedicated PWM driver chip onboard that handles all 
												the motor and speed controls over I2C. The Arduino is then able 
												to communicate to the motor shield to apply power in pulses that 
												effectively changes the speed of the motors. If we want the motors 
												to go faster, we drive the PWM output to a higher duty cycle. If 
												we want the motors to go slower, we drive the PWM output to a lower 
												duty cycle. Note that the motors we used are rated for 12V so we 
												used a 12V power supply for them (see Power section).

											<h3>Sensors</h3>
											<p>
												One of our requirements for our crab was to be able to tell where 
												a person is. We accomplished this through Passive Infrared (PIR) 
												sensors. A PIR motion sensor consists of two main parts: a 
												pyroelectric sensing element and a Fresnel lens. The pyroelectric 
												sensing element can detect infrared radiation. Note that human 
												bodies emit heat energy in the form of infrared radiation. The 
												white dome in front of the sensing element is a Fresnel lens. 
												This lens focuses the infrared radiation onto the sensor.
											</p>
											<p>
												We connected these sensors to analog pins on our Arduino that 
												read the signals from the sensors. See the <a href="https://berwinl.com/pie-2021-03/Hermit/software.html">Software</a> section to 
												learn more about how we used them to detect a person.

											<p>
												Another one of our requirements for our crab was to be able to 
												sense when it has been picked up. We were able to do this through 
												a phototransistor. The phototransistor is a transistor that responds 
												to light striking it by generating and amplifying an electric current. 
												Therefore, we could use the phototransistor to detect a change in light. 
												By putting the phototransistor on the bottom of our crab, we were able 
												to tell when it has been picked up. When it was on the ground, its body 
												would cast a shadow beneath it, meaning that there wasnâ€™t a lot of light 
												hitting the phototransistor. When it was picked up, the phototransistor 
												could be exposed to the light in its surroundings, meaning that there was 
												more light hitting the phototransistor. By doing some testing, we were 
												able to find a threshold reading that we used to determine of the crab 
												has been picked up. To learn more about how we did this, see the 
												<a href="https://berwinl.com/pie-2021-03/Hermit/software.html">Software</a> section.

											<h3>Head Movement</h3>
											<p>
												When the crab is picked up, it retreats its head into its shell. In order to 
												make this movement, we used a servo combined with a slot slider mechanism. 
												This servo was controlled by a digital input on the Arduino. Therefore, to 
												move the head, we programmed the servo to move between 0 and 180 degrees. 
												See the <a href="https://berwinl.com/pie-2021-03/Hermit/software.html">Software</a> 
												section for additional information about the sensing and logic.

											<h3>Power</h3>
											<p>
												To power our crab, we have two sources of power: A 9V battery and a 
												12V power supply. In the schematic, we can see on the bottom right a 
												9V battery connected to a Step Down Converter. This Step Down Converter 
												converts the 9V to 5V. This 5V powers the arduino, the PIR Sensors, 
												the phototransistor, and the servo. Note that even though the Arduino 
												Uno has a built-in low drop-out voltage regulator, we opted to use an 
												external switching regulator due to it being more efficient. 
											</p>
											<p>
												In the schematic, we can see on the top right that the motor 
												shield is powered by 12V. This 12V comes from a power supply 
												and is only used to power the motors. This is due to the 
												operating voltage of the crab being 12V.

											<h3>Testing PIR Sensors</h3>
											<p>
												To first test the PIR sensors we connected the output to an LED as can be seen 
												in the image of the breadboard. The PIR sensor sends high or low signals 
												depending on if it senses anything. Therefore, at default this LED would be off, 
												and when it detected a warm body, the LED would turn on. We used this setup as a 
												means to test whether the PIR sensors worked as intended.

										<h3>Testing Motors</h3>
										<p>
											When designing our crab, there were a couple of trade-offs that we had to take. 
											The first tradeoff involved our motors. The motors that we first used were 6V 
											motors with a 1:100 gear ratio. However, after mounting the motors to the crab, 
											and driving them, we realized that the motors were not powerful enough to drive 
											the crab forward. The legs/motors would simply stay in the same position.
										</p>
										<p>
											Therefore, we decided to get more powerful motors. However, these motors required 
											a higher voltage (12V) and drew a lot more current. When getting these motors we 
											first tested them with a power supply at 12V. In doing so we found that they draw 
											about 0.22 Amp when the leg is not in contact with anything, and they draw about 
											0.29 Amps when stalled. Given this high draw of current, we decided to use a power 
											supply to supply the 12V instead of finding a battery solution. This meant that we 
											had to tether our crab to a wall outlet, but we wouldnâ€™t have to worry about a 
											battery that quickly used up its capacity.
